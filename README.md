# reccon
script to use Nmap and exploit

Brief outline of a Python script that leverages open-source tools like Nmap and Metasploit. This script is intended for use in a controlled environment with proper authorization.

#You can install python-nmap and python-metasploit libraries using pip:

pip install python-nmap
pip install metasploit


    Service and version detection: Enhance the port scanning function to include service and version detection using Nmap's -sV option.

    Logging: Implement logging to store the results of each stage of the scanning process in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).

    Error handling: Add error handling to manage potential exceptions raised by Nmap or Metasploit during the scanning process.

    Scan configuration: Accept command-line arguments or read from a configuration file to customize the scanning process (e.g., target IP range, port range, etc.).

    Scan scheduling: Use a scheduling library, like schedule, to run the scanning process periodically.
    
   
This script includes:

1. Command-line argument parsing for specifying the target IP range.
2. Enhanced port scanning function to include service and version detection.
3. Logging of the scanning results to a JSON file.

Remember to use this script only in controlled environments with proper authorization. Unauthorized network scanning or vulnerability assessment can be considered illegal and unethical.
